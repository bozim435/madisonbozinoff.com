					Variations 1, 2017
				</div>
				<div class="project__body">
					<p>
						Variations 1 explores the possibilities of instruction-based methods in both image-making and typography. Extending the concept of rule-based art to the program, Variations 1 questions whether a set of instructions executed in code can produce unexpected and poetic results.
					</p>
					<p>
						Nine twitter bots create and post images that respond to their individualized sets of instructions. These instructions define a range of compositions consisting of circles on a white square canvas. Similarly, a tenth twitter bot generates single-line letterforms on a white square canvas. The outputs from the twitter bots are then sequentially placed into a grid to be drawn with a pen plotter as physical documentation.  <a class="link--alias" href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/939959879531483138?s=20" target="blank">See twitter bots</a> <a class="link" href="projects/pen-plotter-lines/index.html">See pen plotter lines</a>

					Variations 2, 2018

					<p>
						Variations 2 further explores instruction-based typography with generative letterforms. Tweets are pulled from twitter and typeset with evolving letterforms in three browser-based animations. Each animation in the sequence introduces another random element into the program.

					Little Free Library, 2017
				</div>
				<div class="project__body">
					<p>
						An app for collecting quotes from books found in the Little Free Library of the Green Oasis community garden. The app creates a collectively curated selection of quotes from books that may or may not still be in the library.
					</p>
					<p>
						When reading a book in the physical space, shadows are cast on the book from the readers hands and body, over the course of the day. The app incorporates this phenomenon as a visual layer linking the experience of the app to the experience of the Little Free Library. Depending on the time of day, when a user adds a quote, the quote is &ldquo;stamped&rdquo; with a unique shadow image from the Green Oasis Garden. <a class="link--alias" href="https://invis.io/7YNROO06FJB" target="blank">Prototype</a> <a class="link--alias" href="https://www.usertesting.com/v/d0cac6ba-1700-4a52-aaf4-1fe37ea70228#!/notes" target="blank">User Test</a> <a class="link" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/arena-attachments/1943214/5cce3d210e2f03aada91b956c1aa743e.pdf?1521917137">Presentation</a>

					<p>
						Matter is an online publication and research project centered on the themes of media and memory. The site acts as a catalogue of ideas that explore these themes; such as archiving, collective memory, and memory in the digital age. Each article on the site has a programmed expiration date and fades away until it is erased, reflecting the non-permanence of human memory. <a class="link" href="https://madboz.github.io/reading-without-pages/matter">Matter</a>
