			Input Output explores the possibilities of instruction-based methods in both image-making and typography. By extending the idea of rule-based art to the program, Input Output questions whether a set of instructions executed in code can produce unexpected and poetic results.
		</p>
		<p>
			The initial investigation took the form of ten Twitter bots. The bots both create and post images that respond to a specific set of instructions. These instructions define a range of compositions consisting solely of circles on a white square canvas. Posting every forty seconds, the bots are intended to be exhaustive. The twitter outputs are then taken from their original context and systematically placed into a 3 x 3 grid to be drawn with a pen plotter at large-scale.

			The second project deals with rules and constraints in typography. For this, I created a typeface comprised of programmatically generated letterforms. While my previous project involves a high level of control over its outputs, the second project is nearly completely random. The typeface is exhibited in three browser-based animations where each letterform updates every half-second. Each animation builds off of the previous one by adding more randomized elements as one progresses through them.
